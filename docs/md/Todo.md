## Documentation

---

Following places need to be documented:
<ul>
    <li>ScClient (request/response models, interface, implementation, websocket client)</li>
    <li>ScApi (interface, implementation, methods)</li>
    <li>ScCtx (methods, structures)</li>
</ul>

## Development

<ul>
    <li>Need to cover the library with integration and unit tests</li>
    <li>Develop more structures (like ScSet)</li>
    <li>Support for template search on context level</li>
    <li>Support for template generation on API level</li>
</ul>

If you want to participate in development, feel free to open issues, pull requests.
